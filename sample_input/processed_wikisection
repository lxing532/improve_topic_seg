The Ruins also offers special events and tours throughout the year.
========,3,Dinetah Pueblitos.
For the more remote and off the beaten path archaeological experience, the cultural buff can explore several canyon and mesa areas which were the ancestral homelands of the Navajo people.
Navajo pueblitos (also known as Dinetah Pueblitos) refer to the defensive sites along canyon rims and outcrops that the Navajo people occupied in this region during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
Many of the sites are located on Bureau of Land Management lands and require four-wheel drive and high clearance vehicles to access.
Roads are often not passable when wet.
========,3,Aztec Arches.
East and north of Aztec on public lands managed by the BLM are over 300 natural windows and arches.
Many of these natural arches are small "windows", but there are a number of arches large enough to walk below.
Over 26 canyons have been inventoried for arches and hoodoos.

Mountain biking is very popular in San Juan County, New Mexico.
Aztec has over 30 miles of trails of which the most popular is the Alien Run Trail.
The trail is located on BLM lands and consists of a short loop (6.1 mi easy-moderate), long loop (additional 3.4 mi moderate) and the outer limits loop (6.7 mi difficult).
========,3,Angel Peak Scenic Area.
More public lands administered by the BLM, the Angel Peak Scenic Area offers a more colorful badlands and canyon landscape in contrast to the Bisti or Lybrook badlands.
Three picnic areas and one campground with nine tent sites is available on a first-come, first-served basis.
========,3,Bisti /De-Na-Zin Wilderness.
The Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness is public land managed by the BLM.
Originally formed through the deposition of sediments from an ancient sea and river deltas millions of years ago, subsequent millions of years of erosion has carved out strange land forms, hoodoos and has exposed lots of petrified logs and stumps.
It is also famous for several major dinosaur finds including "Spike" the Pentaceratops and "the Bisti Beast" a Bistahieversornow Tyrannosaur on display at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.
The western portion of this wilderness is known as the Bisti while the eastern portion is known as the De-Na-Zin.
Each area offers slightly different geological deposits and land formations.
Evening photography is the best as the sunsets provide a blazing palette of oranges and reds.
========,3,Ah-Shi-Sle-Pah Wilderness Study Area.
Similar to the Bisti, Ah-Shi-Sle-Pah Wilderness Study Area is located between the Bisti /De-Na-Zin Wilderness and Chaco Canyon.
Also managed by the BLM, this area formed in similar fashion as the Bisti.
However this region has more multi-colored sandstone deposits, strange hoodoos, petrified wood, and dinosaur bones.
One of the first Pentaceratops was collected from here by Charles Sternberg.
========,3,Lybrook Badlands.
Yet another area managed by the BLM, this area was formed about the same time as the Bisti and Ah-Shi-Sle-Pah.
This region offers a uniquely different scale of landscape.
Hoodoo in this region are massive and the terrain much greater in elevation differences, thereby exposing a greater geological time frame than the Bisti or Ah-Shi-Sle-Pah.
This region is a bit more accessible due to oil field roads traversing the region.
However, extreme caution is required when driving on as these roads as they are impassible when wet.
